#### Single-line Summary
**Today, Anwar and Meryl paired together. It took about 2 hours**

#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we started on linking articleView.js to index.html.
  2. Next, we modified article.js to set the data-author attribute on each article tag.
  3. Next, we added the category filter methods on each article and made sure the author method was cleared if a category was selected. 
  4. We finished the handleMainNav function so that when you click on a specific tab, all others will hide and the appropriate tab's content will be on the page.
  5. Worked on making setTeasers function reveal content when 'read more' is pressed.
  6. Completed read more / show less functionality using toggleClass.
  7. We added styling to the header and links within the main section of the page.
